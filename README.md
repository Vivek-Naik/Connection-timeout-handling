# Connection-timeout-handling
1.open a split terminal and run the server.py and client.py 
2.set the connection timeout  duration and start the server
3.send the message from client to the server within the timeout duration so that the server recieves the message
4.If the connection is timed out server cant recieve message from client 
5.To avoid this either restart the server or increase the connection timeout duration
